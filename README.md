I'm excited to present my latest project, a command-line utility suite designed to enhance the productivity and efficiency of developers. This suite consists of three powerful commands that simplify common tasks, making your workflow smoother and more efficient.

1. fsearch
The fsearch command allows users to search for a specific string within a file. Whether you're tracking down a piece of code, a configuration setting, or any text, fsearch quickly and accurately locates the desired string.

Usage: fsearch <string> <file>
Features:
Fast and efficient string search within files
Supports various file formats

2. dsearch
The dsearch command is designed to search for files within a directory. It navigates through complex directory structures to find files based on your search criteria, saving you time and effort.

Usage: dsearch <filename> <directory>
Features:
Recursive search through directories
Options to filter by file type, size, and modification date

3. Anant
Anant is a versatile compiler and executor for C, C++, and Java programs. This command streamlines the process of compiling and running code, providing a unified interface for multiple programming languages.

Usage: Anant <source-file>
Features:
Supports C, C++, and Java
Single command to compile and run programs

Why This Project?
Originally these commands were created to help the Linux beginners adapt to the environment without getting intimidated by the syntax and usage of the powerful utilities present in the Linux Kernal but as the project advanced and recommendations from beginner and intermediate developers I created a compiler-suit which can compile and execute C/C++/JAVA files. This
command-line utility suite is designed to reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks, allowing developers to focus on what matters most: writing great code. By providing straightforward, powerful tools, this project aims to make everyday tasks easier and more efficient.

Get Involved
I'm eager to share this project with the developer community and welcome any feedback, contributions, or suggestions. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, these tools are designed to help you work smarter, not harder.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in contributing or have ideas on how to improve the suite. Let's work together to enhance the productivity of developers everywhere!
