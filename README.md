Welcome to my repository, which features a set of three custom Linux commands designed to make command-line tasks simpler and more efficient. Here's a detailed description of each component:

fsearch
fsearch is a simplified command designed to quickly search for content within files. It replaces the need for more complex command-line pipelines like cat [filename] | grep [content]. With fsearch, you can easily locate specific text within a file by providing the filename and the desired content. This tool reduces unnecessary complexity and enhances productivity for users who frequently work with text-based data.

dsearch
dsearch is a command that streamlines the process of searching for specific files within a given directory. It eliminates the need for using ls and grep in combination. By providing the directory path and the filename, dsearch returns a list of files that match the given criteria, simplifying file search operations in complex directory structures. This command is particularly useful for users who manage large file systems or need quick access to specific files.

anant
anant is an all-in-one compiler that supports C, C++, and Java programming languages. This command offers a unified interface for compiling code and provides integrated debugging features using gdb and jdb. With anant, you can compile your code and access a debug menu without switching between different tools. This single-command solution improves workflow efficiency and reduces the learning curve for developers working with multiple languages.

Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to make common command-line tasks more accessible and less cumbersome. By simplifying complex command sequences and integrating multiple tools into single commands, this repository aims to enhance productivity and usability in the Linux environment.

How to Use
Each command can be used by running the respective command name followed by the appropriate arguments. For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation included in this repository.
